# LeafGAN Replication
A Semi-Replication of LeafGAN for Sick Leaves Identification

This is a project for the course of Deep Learning at Istanbul Technical University. The project aims to replicate the LeafGAN project on our own datasets. 1 of the datasets is for cucumber leaves while the other is for tomato leaves. The cucmber leaves were a combination of images collected via the internet and some images from a dataset (comes from an uncontolled environment), and the tomato leaves come completely from a controlled domain envirnoment dataset
